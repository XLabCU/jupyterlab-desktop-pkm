# Known Issues & Future Development

## üêõ Current Issues (Post-PyPI Publication)

### Workspace Loading Issues
**Status**: Identified, needs investigation  
**Severity**: High  
**Description**: After publishing to PyPI and installing in JupyterLab Desktop, there are issues with:
- Opening workspace properly
- Source view/preview focus management
- Extension initialization in production environment

**Potential Causes**:
- Development vs production environment differences
- Extension loading order in JupyterLab Desktop
- File watcher/focus detection conflicts
- State management during startup

**Next Steps**:
- Test in isolated environment with clean JupyterLab installation
- Debug extension loading sequence
- Review markdown preview toggle logic for production builds
- Check for console errors during workspace initialization

### Preview/Source Toggle Focus Issues
**Status**: Intermittent, needs refinement  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Description**: The source/preview toggle sometimes gets out of sync when multiple markdown files are open
- Button state doesn't always reflect current file mode
- Toggle affects wrong file in some scenarios

**Investigation Areas**:
- `app.shell.currentWidget` reliability
- Widget focus detection timing
- Multiple file tracking logic

## üîÑ Development Environment vs Production

### Differences Observed
- **Development**: Extension works reliably with `jupyter labextension develop`
- **Production**: Issues appear after `pip install` from PyPI
- **Possible Factor**: Build process differences or packaging issues

### Debug Strategy
1. Compare development vs production builds
2. Test installation from local wheel file
3. Check extension loading logs
4. Verify all assets are properly bundled

## üìã Future Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] Fix workspace loading issues
- [ ] Improve source/preview toggle reliability
- [ ] Add error handling for startup failures
- [ ] Create diagnostic tools for troubleshooting

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Performance optimization for large workspaces
- [ ] Better wikilink auto-completion
- [ ] Enhanced search functionality
- [ ] Mobile/responsive design improvements

### Low Priority
- [ ] Themes and customization
- [ ] Advanced PKM features (tags, graph view)
- [ ] Integration with external tools
- [ ] Export/import functionality

## üîß Debugging Tools Needed

### Extension Diagnostics
- Add console logging for extension lifecycle
- Create health check command
- Monitor widget focus changes
- Track file opening/closing events

### User Reporting
- Standardized issue template
- System info collection
- Extension version verification
- Conflict detection with other extensions
